# Mars Exploration Station Simulator

MarsExploration is a simple command-line simulator for a hypothetical Mars exploaration mission. This project was assigned to us during Data Structures and Algorithms course. It was aimed after the completion of this project that we will be able to:
- Understand unstructured, natural language problem description and derive an appropriate
design.
- Intuitively modularize a design into independent components and divide these components
among team members.
- Build and use data structures to implement the proposed design.
- Write a complete object-oriented C++ program that performs a non-trivial task.

# Context for the simulator

In the hope of getting to know more about Mars and the possibility of life on its surface, a
huge number of exploratory missions to different regions of the planet need to be conducted.
Imagine (at some future time) that we have several rovers of different types and capabilities on the
surface of Mars ready to carry out missions to its different regions. There is also a hypothetical
base station which acts as the central point from which the different rovers begin their exploratory
missions and to which they return after mission completion. The base station basically assigns
missions to the different rovers.

# How it works
It gets from the user information about the rovers and the missions required, Then it will simulates the mission assignment process and calculates some related statistics in order to help improve the overall process. 

There are 3 interface modes available
  - Interactive mode
  - Step-by-step mode
  - Silent mode

The description of each mode and more of the program details is available on the project description file.
